## Embrace your community

^ throughout my career of highs and lows, wanting to learn and grow, I've really learned that the community I have is the thing that will keep me around.
^ when RT fell through, my network got me interviews

---

## Teach your community

^ they say that the best way to learn is to teach.
^ a few years ago, I decided to make my first online class for beginner web devs, and I learned SO MUCH in the process, understood more than ever before
^ built tutorials for projects I was building
^ technical newsletter to practice interview questions
^ pay it forward

## Be a Giver, not a Taker

^ Remember Parks & Rec?

^ Often when people network with others, they immediately think of "how can I get the most out of this relationship." This leads to awkward mentorship proposals (side note, don't), unrealistic asks, and honestly, eventually, people screening your emails and calls.
^ You don't want people to have even the slightest bit of dread when they see a message from you! (This goes out to you, managers)

^ You want to be the one that passes along job leads, shares information, connects others, and helps people grow. You want the people around you to enthusiastically take your calls and messages when you need them most!

^ A community is a give and a take, and if you only take, that's not community building.
