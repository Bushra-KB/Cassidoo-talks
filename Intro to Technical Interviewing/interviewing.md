#Tech interviews **vary**.

^Large companies, mid-size, and startups all focus on different things.

---

#The process per company is fairly consistent.

^There's almost always a phone round, maybe a coding challenge, an onsite, and

^some combination of the three.

#The Coding Challenge

#The Onsite

---

#The Onsite
- Past Projects
- Engineering discussion
- Culture Fit
- **Whiteboarding**

^We're going to focus on whiteboarding.

#Companies **vary** in their whiteboarding questions

^Startups tend to focus on practical ideas (like how to use a given framework),

^mid-size companies tend to focus on architecture and how you'd structure a large

^application, and large companies tend to have a combo of algorithms and arch.

#Approaching the problem

---

#Talk out what you're thinking!

#Once you've talked it out, *that's* when you write

---

#Let's practice.

---

---

##Find the minimum edit distance between two strings.

---

##Build Imgur.
