#Problem:
##It's hard to start and work through a side project.

^Obsessing over technical details and figuring out how to approach a task is tough!

#Iterate! Approach the project in sprints.
^Build a scooter first, then a bike, then a motorcycle, then a four-wheeler, then a car, then an SUV.
^Build a working feature before pushing out parts of a project or a library.
^It should "work" at every step.

---

#Set rules for yourself.
^Whether it's to make a certain number of commits per week, to share the project only with certain people,
^work a certain amount of time per day, or something else, you need rules to keep a project going.

---

#The feeling of making progress is *just as important* as actual progress.
^Embracing this is a great way to alleviate personal stress as you build.

---

#Working on projects doesn't always mean coding.
^Sometimes just drawing out diagrams or thinking about a particular problem is the most effective thing you can do.

---

#Log your work.
^Whether you just copy and paste commit messages, write in a journal, or publish a blog, logging your work keeps you accountable.

---

#Don't forget to focus on *why* you're doing this project.
^Put together a list of reasons why you want to build something before freaking out about the details.
