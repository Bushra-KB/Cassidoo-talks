#Why are communities important?

![](woodbg.jpg)

---

> No matter the field, if one doesn't have a community around them, they will not stay in said field.

^ I have a theory.

---

#This is particularly important in tech.

^Why?

---

#Product quality is dependent on diversity among the producers.

---

#Our ratios are terribly skewed.

![](woodbg.jpg)

^Everyone knows, birds of a feather flock together.
^Because we have such skewed proportions of different groups of people,
^not every minority group feels like they belong.
^As a result, retention for minority groups is horrible.
^And then, it snowballs.

---

#So, we have to build positive communities to offset that!

---

#There are 3 major pillars of a thriving tech community. 

---

#The 3 Pillars
- Advising
- Advocacy
- Accelerating

^I admit I didn't come up with these myself, I worked on
^ a team at a hackathon where we focused on that.
^ But that's a story for another time.

#Advise
^ what's the first thing you think of when you think of advising others?

---

>Mentorship!

^Fostering a mentorship culture is huge
^You learn by teaching
^Lift as you climb

---

#Advocate

---

>Publicly recommend and support each other!

^Everyone should know what you and your community stand for.
^My fave way to do this is a code of conduct.

---

#Code of Conduct

- hackcodeofconduct.org
- Hacker School's social rules

^Feigning surprise, well-actually's, backseat driving, subtle-isms.
^Don't be a jerk.

#Accelerate

^Accelerating ties the last two pillars together.

---

>Better each other!

^Through friendship, scholarship, sponsorship, mentorship
^Help people get opportunities, and they'll help each other

---

#Advise
#Advocate
#Accelerate

^It takes dedication to pull these off.
^It probably won't just work out in a day.

>Life is a marathon, not a sprint.
