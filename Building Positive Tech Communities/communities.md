#Why are communities important?

> No matter the field, if one doesn't have a community around them, they will not stay in said field.

^ I have a theory.

---

#This is particularly important in tech.

^Why?

---

#Product quality is dependent on diversity among the producers.

---

#Our ratios are terribly skewed.

![](woodbg.jpg)

^Everyone knows, birds of a feather flock together.
^Because we have such skewed proportions of different groups of people,
^not every minority group feels like they belong.
^As a result, retention for minority groups is horrible.
^And then, it snowballs.

---

#So, we have to build positive communities to offset that!

---

#There are 3 major pillars of a thriving tech community. 

---

#The 3 Pillars
- Advocacy
- Advising
- Accelerating

^I admit I didn't come up with these myself, I worked on
^ a team at a hackathon where we focused on that.
^ But that's a story for another time.
