# How to Prepare

---

## You don't actually *have* to.

^ So first of all, you don't actually need to prepare for a hackathon. You can totally go in knowing nothing, and it's fine. Hackathons today are very geared towards newbies, so don't be intimidated!

---

## Form a team

^ It's a really good idea to come in with a team. It'll let you get up and running faster. It's espectially good if you actually know each other's strengths and try to work with each of them.

---

## Form an idea

---

## Form an idea
- Have a handful of ideas that you would like
- Don't bring the best idea you've ever had
- Keep It Simple, Stupid

^ Bringing the best idea you've ever had will end up disappointing you, because you won't get to dedicate the amount of time you want to towards this project.

^ As you learn more about sponsors, let your ideas be flexible so you can try to get some awesome API prizes.

^ Tip: Make your ideas generic at first, and then add cool features

---

## Get your environment set up

^ Installing things, documentation ready, etc.
