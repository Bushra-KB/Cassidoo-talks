# _Impostor Syndrome_
### What it is, and how to fight it

---

What the heck is Impostor Syndrome?

---

"...a psychological phenomenon in which people are unable to internalize their accomplishments. Despite external evidence of their competence, those with the syndrome remain convinced that they are frauds and do not deserve the success they have achieved."

---

"Proof of success is dismissed as luck, timing, or as a result of deceiving others into thinking they are more intelligent and competent than they believe themselves to be. Notably, impostor syndrome is _particularly common among high-achieving women._"

---

## "Oh crap, I don't know what I'm doing, and everyone's going to find out."

---

# Your brain is not nice.
^ It's awful because you can't take pride in your own work.

^ It's awful because you can't admit when you don't know something.

^ It's awful because it prevents you from asking questions.

^ It's awful because it prevents other people from having perspective.

---

# You’re not alone.
^ Psychological research studies have found that at least 70% of people feel like impostors at one time or another.

---

"The exaggerated esteem in which my lifework is held makes me very ill at ease. I feel compelled to think of myself as an involuntary swindler."
- Albert Einstein

---

“I have written eleven books, but each time I think, ‘Uh oh, they’re going to find out now. I’ve run a game on everybody, and they’re going to find me out.’”
- Maya Angelou

---

“You think, ‘Why would anyone want to see me again in a movie? And I don’t know how to act anyway, so why am I doing this?’”
- Meryl Streep

---

# There's been a lot of research around this.
^ Researchers Pauline Clance and Suzanne Imes observed high-achieving women and found several behaviors that were common.

---

## Diligence
^ Gifted women work hard in order to prevent being found out.

^ This leads to more praise and success, which perpetuates the feelings.

---

## Feeling of being a phony
^ Attempts to give supervisors the answers that she believes they want, which leads her to think that she's being a fake.

---

## Use of charm
^ Often women use intuitive perceptiveness and charm to gain approval and praise, and seek relationships with supervisors in order to increase intellectual and creative abilities.

^ Unfortunately, when she then receives recognition, then she feels it's because of the charm and not ability.

^ She believes if she actually believes in her intelligence and abilities she may be rejected by others

^ She may convince herself that she is not intelligent or does not deserve success to avoid this

^ They're so mean.

---

# There _*are*_ ways to prevent this!

---

## Talk about it!
^ You're more likely to hear people feeling the same way, and you get validated.

^ People might be able to talk some sense into you.

---

## Watch your language

---

# Watch your language
- "Just" and "Only"
- "I think" and "I don't know if"
- "I'm not a REAL ______"
- "Used to"
- "Should"

^ You talk yourself into thinking you're less experienced!

^ Convinces you of your lack of authority.

^ Convinces you that you're a phony.

^ Puts your accomplishments in your past.

^ This has a lot of implied meaning to it. It's a club you beat yourself up with. It says you're not living up to something.

---

## Teach what you know
^ Even if you think you don't know it!

---

## Ask questions
^ It's hard because you don't want people to know that you don't know what you're talking about.

^ If you don't know something small, IS can take over and you’ll work slower on something because you’ll dwell on not knowing, rather than just asking a question and moving forward with confidence because you have the answer you need.

---

## Get perspective
^ A friend can be on your project, on a completely different team, or not even in your own company. Just ask for a second pair of eyes.

---

## List your accomplishments and *own* them!
^ We have #victory, my manager asks what I'm proud of

---

## Practice accepting compliments
^ If you don't accept compliments, it convinces your brain that your accomplishments are minimal.

---

## Remember that you are *awesome*.
^ You're not where you are just because you're a diversity figure, or because you knew someone, or because you lucked out. You got here because you earned it.
