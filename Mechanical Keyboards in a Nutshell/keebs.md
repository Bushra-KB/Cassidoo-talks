## What are mechanical keyboards?

---

## What are mechanical keyboards?

- A keyboard built with high quality, typically spring activated, key switches
- They became popular because of the drop in quality of keyboards in the 90s

^ Some of the first widely sold keyboards such as IBMâ€™s Model M in the 1980s utilized mechanical switches

^ The 90s brought a wave of inexpensive rubber dome keyboards that flooded the market

^ Rubber dome keyboards represent over 90% of keyboards in use today and provide an inexpensive but often dissatisfying feel and typing experience

## Why mechanical keyboards

## Why mechanical keyboards

- Switches, framing, functionality, type print methods, key construction, PCB board, LED lighting (sharpness, brightness, adjustability), and more are far superior
- It just feels good

# Switches

# Switches

There's dozens of switch types available for mechanical keyboards.

# Switches

- *Linear*: Have no bump before bottoming out. They travel smoothly.
- *Tactile*: Have a bump you can feel in the key press before bottoming out.
- *Clicky*: Make an audible 'click' when typing.

# Switches

- There's other aspects of switches that I won't cover today
  - Actuation force per switch (how hard you have to press to register a keypress)
  - Custom switches (you can take apart switches and add your own features)
  - Non-standard switch brands/types (Gateron, Matias, Topre)

# Keycaps

---

# Keycaps

- Keycaps make no real difference to how your keyboard works
- They are pretty
- They come in different profiles

# Keycap Profiles

- I've gone through some of the more popular keycap profiles (there are many more)
- Some profiles and colors are more rare than others

---

# Artisan Keycaps

- Artisan keycaps are keycaps made by artisans (whaaat)
- Some are cheap, as one might expect, and some are obscenely expensive

# Custom Cables

---

# Custom Cables

- Yes, people go so far as to getting their own custom USB cables
- It's common to get a cable that matches your keycaps
- There are kits available online for making your own, as well as ready-made ones

# Programming

# Programming

- The fun NEVER ENDS when programming is involved
- Many mechanical keyboards are completely programmable
  - Keymap layers
  - LED programming
  - Sometimes audio
