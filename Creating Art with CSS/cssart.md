## Why are you encouraging this?

- Making CSS art will make you better at CSS
- Making CSS art will help you see graphics modularly
- Making CSS art will force you to think critically about how you organize your code

^ I first started playing around with CSS art when I found my CSS skills lacking. I started by making more functional things, but then moved on to trying to make drawings with it.
^ Making these drawings has helped me not only improve my ability to write CSS, but also my organization and ability to solve weird layout problems.
