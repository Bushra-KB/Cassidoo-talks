> "Lift as you climb"

^ This phrase is one that a mentor told me when I was first entering the workforce.
^ She told me that those who are great are both mentored and mentor others who are great.
^ That being said, I think that it's not just great people this applies to, but companies and teams as well.

^ As your brand grows, you will inevitably need to expand your team and community to the next level.
^ But, as you know, there's only so many evangelists on the market in this ever-growing field.

#[fit] If you can't find them
#[fit] **Make them yourself**

^ So, what do you do when you can't find evangelists to hire? You create hireable evangelists.
^ You make your users your evangelists.

^ Flashback to 2015, I joined small startup Clarifai as their 17th employee.

^ My sister and I were the only two evangelists in the company, and we had to show their awesome technology to the world, somehow.
^ We did the standard "go to hackathons and conferences and meetups all the time" thing, but that was not only tiring, but limited because of our small team.

^ Thus, the Clarifai Champions were born!

^ Quick flashback, back when I was in school, Twilio started a 6-month evangelism training program.
^ There were 12 of us in the program, and it started strong and sort of tapered off at the end because of schedules of both the participants and the evangelists.

^ After asking politely if we could rip off Twilio's idea...

# **You** can do this, too!

The next generation of evangelists are out there, they just don't know it yet!

^ Computer science graduates, hackathon goers, open source contributors, bootcamp grads, they all have the passion for coding. They often also have the passion for the community, too.

---

# Your job is to train them how to **communicate**

^ Through projects for your company, they can exercise their speaking, writing, mentoring, and social skills.
^ It's a self-selecting group. Their passion is there, you just have to help guide it.
